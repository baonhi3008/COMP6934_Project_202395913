        <h3> How have energy consumption and CO₂ emissions evolved across regions with rising urbanization and GDP, and does a shift in energy mix indicate mitigation? </h3>
        <p>
          This visualization explores how GDP, urbanization, and population
          relate to energy consumption and emissions.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Data Loading</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            CSV data is loaded using <code>d3.csv</code> and parsed into
            <code>rawData</code>, those columns like year, gdp, co2, etc. will
            be converted into numeric values.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Controls & Interaction</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A year slider (yearSlider) to pick a year between 1993–2022.</li>
          <li>
            Region Dropdown: Lets users filter the dataset by geographic level:
            globally, by continent (mapped to subregions), or by specific
            subregions. This changes the scope for the map, scatter plot, and
            line charts accordingly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then user can select an environmental metric dropdown to pick
            includes CO₂, CO₂ per capita, methane, methane per capita, and
            shared global CO₂; this will be the encoded colors of the map as a
            choropleth.
          </li>
          <li>
            Optional metrics, when displayed, depend on user choice. If the user
            ticks on the show consumption checkbox, then a drop-down values
            display allows the user to pick whether the bubble overlay on the
            map shows a consumption metric (Primary vs. Per-Capita) for bubble
            size.
          </li>
          <li>
            Another optional metric will be the bubble color encoding as an
            extra channel; if the user ticks on the check box, then a drop-down
            appears that allows the user to pick the economic metric (GDP, GDP
            per capita, or Urbanization) for bubble color.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Map & Bubbles and overview interation:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When the user selects a region on the drop-down from the region
            label, then depending on how global, region, or subregion mode, the
            corresponding filtered data is shown.
          </li>
          <li>
             Logic of filtering / “Modes”The code checks your
            selected region. If “Global,” it uses all countries. If a continent,
            it uses subregions. If a subregion, it uses only that subregion.
          </li>
          <li>The code sets centerInfo for the map so the map can recenter.</li>
          <li>
            Each chart’s data is then re-filtered or regrouped based on the same
            region mode.
          </li>
          <li>
            A choropleth map will be zoomed into that region, subregion with
            another part of the map will be whiteed out; this is the focus mode.
            Then, the panel below provides an overview of basic visual design
            with the corresponding mode.
          </li>
          <li>
            A bubble trace, the bubble size is scaled based on “consumption
            metric,” color is from economic metric (GDP, GDP Per Capita,
            Urbanization rate). When the user clicks on any country, a detail
            card about that country appears, showing information about the
            overtime trend with a combined bar + line chart of environmental
            metrics and a showDetailCard(record) for that country.
          </li>

          <li>
            Scatter Chart (#1): The relationship between consumption and GDP of
            region or country depends on which region mode user selected. Points
            are colored by the environmental bin functions from environmental
            metrict.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scatter Chart (#2): The relationship between consumption per capita
            and environmental metric per capita of region or country depends on
            which region mode the user selected. Points are color-binned by the
            economic metric with the same bin as the choropleth map, your bubble
            color bins.
          </li>
          <li>
            Line Chart (#1): Show the selected environmental metric trend over a
            period of time from 1993 to 2022. The filtering logic for this line
            is below: If “Global” is selected, it groups by continent. If a
            continent is selected, it shows a line for the entire region plus
            lines for each subregion. If a subregion is selected, it shows lines
            for each country.
          </li>
          <li>
            Line Chart (#2): This line chart is similar to the above line chart,
            but for the consumption metric (Primary vs. Per-Capita). Also
            displayed from 1993–2022, with same grouping logic
          </li>
          <li>
            Multi-Stacked-Area: There is an area that contains a small multiple
            or faceted stacked area chart that offers information about the
            energy type consumption, allowing an exploration of the energy
            shifting process. After the data is filtered based on mode, they
            will be grouped, and for each group, it creates a separate stacked
            area chart showing “Coal, Oil, Gas, Nuclear, Renewables, Other
            Renewables.”
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>4. Dropdown / Checkbox Effects</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Environment metric: sets which environmental metric is used on the
            map’s choropleth, as well as on the first time-series line chart.
          </li>
          <li>
            Economic metric (bubble color): sets which economic metric is used
            to color bubbles on the map and the second scatter chart.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consumption metric (bubble size) + “Show Consumption Metric”
            checkbox: picks which consumption metric is used for bubble sizes,
            as well as the second line chart.

            A year slider (yearSlider): Allows users to select a specific year

            and line charts) to reflect the data from the selected year in real

            <li>
              Consumption Metric: Determines the bubble size and y-axis in the

        <div class="accordion-content">
          <h3> How does GDP per capita growth relate to electricity access and clean fuel access improvements? </h3>
          <p>
            This dashboard investigates whether improvements in economic development—measured by GDP per capita—are associated with gains in electricity access and access to clean fuels for cooking. It allows users to switch between these two core access indicators and explore their relationship with economic performance and renewable energy deployment. The tool supports both regional and temporal exploration with interactive and coordinated multi-view visualizations.
